🧭 Squarespace Template Selection — Step-by-Step for a New User
🩵 PHASE 1: Starting from the Squarespace Homepage

Go to squarespace.com

→ You’ll land on their main marketing page with buttons like Get Started, Start Free Trial, or Templates.

Click “Templates” in the top navigation (or “Get Started”)
→ This takes you to the full template gallery, where you can browse design options.

🩶 PHASE 2: Browsing and Previewing Templates

Browse by Category

Use filters like Portfolio, Blog, Online Store, Consulting, Real Estate, etc.

These filters help narrow designs based on your business type.

Click a Template Thumbnail
→ You’ll enter a live demo preview of that template.

You can scroll, click through pages, and view how it looks on desktop and mobile.

The demo site often has fake text and images to simulate a real business.

Optional: Click “Preview in New Tab” or “View Demo Site” (if available)
→ This opens a full-screen version so you can experience it as a visitor would.

Compare multiple templates
→ You can go back and click other templates to preview their demo sites the same way.

🩵 PHASE 3: Choosing a Template to Start With

Click “Start With This Design” (or “Start with [Template Name]”)
→ This begins a free trial site using that design as your starting layout.

Squarespace will prompt you to create an account (email, Google, or Apple login).

You’ll automatically enter the site editor once signed in.

Name your site (optional)
→ You can give it a title like “Sarah’s Salon” or “Kellough Designs” to appear on top of pages.
(This can be changed later.)

🩶 PHASE 4: Editing & Previewing Before Going Live

You’re now inside the Site Editor.
→ From here, you can:

Click Edit on any page section to replace demo content.

Click Design → Site Styles to change fonts, colors, and layout spacing.

Use Pages in the sidebar to add or delete pages.

Use “Preview Mode” before publishing

Click the eye icon (👁️) or “Preview” button in the top bar.

This lets you see what the site will look like live — but it’s not public yet.

Choose visibility settings

You can keep your site private while you edit.

Use Settings → Site Availability → Private or Password Protected to prevent public access.

🩵 PHASE 5: Publishing or Switching

When you’re ready, click “Publish” or “Set Site Live.”

You’ll be prompted to choose a custom domain or keep the free Squarespace trial URL (e.g., my-site.squarespace.com).

Once published, the site becomes visible to the public.

If you want to try another design:

In Squarespace 7.0: go to Design → Templates → Install New Template → Preview → Set Live when ready.

In Squarespace 7.1: you must start a new site to use a totally different template. (All 7.1 templates share one base design system.)
