Terms of Service Effective Date: [Insert Date] Website: https://www.landingpagesforagents.com Company: Landing Pages for Agents, LLC (“we,” “our,” “us”)
By accessing or using LandingPagesForAgents.com (“the Site”) and any of our products or services, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service (“Terms”) and our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with any part of these Terms, you should not use our Site or services. Landing Pages for Agents provides website templates, design services, and related marketing tools for insurance agents and agencies. Our services include pre-designed templates, hosting, domain setup, business email, and optional custom website development. All content appearing on our sample templates is placeholder or “filler” content, intended only as an example. It is the client’s sole responsibility to replace all placeholder content with accurate, truthful, and compliant information relevant to their business, services, and licensing. Clients are solely responsible for the accuracy, legality, and truthfulness of all information, testimonials, claims, or representations displayed on their website or landing page. Landing Pages for Agents does not verify, approve, or guarantee the accuracy of any content provided by clients or third parties, and any misuse, false advertising, or violation of law arising from client use is the full responsibility of the client. Clients agree to indemnify and hold harmless Landing Pages for Agents from any claims, losses, liabilities, or damages resulting from the use or misuse of their site or content.
All subscriptions through Landing Pages for Agents are twelve (12) month agreements beginning on the date of the initial payment. By subscribing, you agree to maintain your subscription for the full twelve-month term. If your subscription is canceled or terminated before the end of the twelve-month period, Landing Pages for Agents reserves the right to bill you for the remaining balance of the term. Subscriptions automatically renew at the end of the twelve-month period unless canceled in writing before renewal. Early cancellation does not relieve you of your obligation to pay the full amount owed under the agreement. All payments are securely processed through trusted third-party payment vendors such as Stripe. Landing Pages for Agents does not store or have access to your credit card or financial information. By purchasing a subscription or service, you authorize Landing Pages for Agents to automatically charge your designated payment method for subscription renewals, outstanding balances, or remaining months in the event of early cancellation. All payments are final and non-refundable except as required by law.
All website designs, templates, and materials created by Landing Pages for Agents remain our intellectual property unless otherwise agreed upon in writing. Clients are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use their purchased site or template for their own business operations. We may utilize third-party services such as Stripe, hosting providers, and domain registrars to support our platform, and we are not responsible for any interruptions, data loss, or errors caused by such third parties. Our services and materials are provided “as is” and “as available,” without warranties of any kind, either express or implied. Landing Pages for Agents shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages resulting from the use or inability to use our Site or services, including but not limited to damages arising from inaccurate or misleading client content, technical issues, data interruptions, or third-party actions.
We reserve the right to suspend or terminate any account at our discretion if a client violates these Terms, misuses our intellectual property, or engages in unlawful activity. Upon termination, all outstanding payments under the twelve-month agreement remain due in full. These Terms may be updated or modified at any time without prior notice. The most recent version will always be available on our website, and continued use of our services constitutes acceptance of any updates or modifications. These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of South Carolina, without regard to conflict of law provisions.
